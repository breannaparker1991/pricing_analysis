# Pricing Analysis By Breanna Parker

Background/History: two datasets were given; one includes the source, device, and operative system of the users, while the other includes the location of the users. These users bought the same product at different price points to predict which price would make the most revenue for the company. 

Data Explanation (Data prep/Data dictionary/etc): The two datasets were combined via the user_id column. Missing data was removed becasue it was a very insignificant amount. Duplicates were also checked for and I made sure that the price points were correctly labeled. I created a series of graphs to see how the revenue differed based on the location, device, operative system, and day of the week. 

Methods: I also looked at the top cities with the most users to see what that impact was on the revenue. including looking at the minimum numbers of users needed to make sure that the data is accurate

Conclusion: The larger price almost always brought in more revenue than the smaller price point. However, this was only tested for three months of the year, during the summer, which excluded the holidays. I think more research needs to be done, especially on including a discounted price, with the lower price point. Wednesday was also the only day of the week when the lower price point brought in more revenue. So, making a discount on wednesdays would be a good opportunity to allow people who can't afford the lower price point to afford the product, while also making the most revenue possible for the company. This might also be helpful during the holidays, when people are often looking for good deals and more people are spending money so there's more opportunity for a high revenue. 

Assumptions: The biggest assumption here is that the suggeted fluctuating price point is the best method for the highest revenue based on the limited datasets given. Ideally, the customers would continued to be monitored with the new fluctuating prices to make sure that the revenue is always the best that the company is able to get at the time. Consumerism is constantly changing so it's important to continue to monitor and update the data accordingly. 

Limitations: There were only three months of data given for these price points, which isn't enough to really see all of the different fluctuations in spending habits. 

Future Uses/Additional applications: Companies always need to know the best price for their product to get reach the most people and make the most revenue. It would be important to continue to do research on a weekly basis to constantly update pricing. 

Ethical Assessment: It's definitely frustrating for consumers who want to buy a product that a company paid $1 but they are being charged $20. Many people would have more money to spend on themselves, or vacations, or even just to take care of their families, if companies based pricing strictly on how much was spent on an item, and not how much money they can make from people. If everything just had a strict 50% markup, the business could still make money, and people could have a higher standard of living. However, companies want to grow and make more money so this is what they will need to use to do that.
